# Write MDX

Smooth DOC uses MDX under the hood. A powerful markup language!

<carbon-ad />

## Use markdown syntax

MDX supports Markdown out of the box. Creating a page is easy as:

```md
# Title of the page

Content of your page.
```

To learn more about markdown, see [markdown cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## Metadata

Features like title, slug and navigation information take place in the frontmatter — a section present at the top of the markdown file written in YAML syntax.

```md
---
title: Write MDX # Title of your page
slug: /docs/write-mdx/ # Slug of your page (uses file name as default)
section: Usage # Sidebar navigation group title
order: 2 # Order in the sidebar navigation group
---

Your page content...
```

## Code

To include a highlighted code snippet, use markdown code block syntax followed by language. Syntax highlighting is built-in thanks to [Prism](https://prismjs.com/).

````md
An example of code block:

```js
const foo = 'bar'
```
````

Read [React Live Editor Guide](/docs/react-live-editor/) to learn how to create interactive examples.

### Supported languages

By default, all languages included in [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/blob/master/src/vendor/prism/includeLangs.js) are supported.

If you want to highlight code in another language such as Ruby or Rust, you can enable it by adding the following in `gatsby-browser.js` ([see GitHub issue](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer/issues/53#issuecomment-546653848)):

```js
import Prism from 'prism-react-renderer/prism'

(typeof global !== 'undefined' ? global : window).Prism = Prism

require('prismjs/components/prism-ruby')
require('prismjs/components/prism-rust')
```

## Custom components

MDX allows you to include your own components. To do it, add an `import` statement directly in your MDX file and use your component.

```
---
name: Hello world
---

import { Button } from './Button'

# Hello world

Hello, I'm still a MDX file, but now I have a button component !

<Button onClick={() => { alert("You clicked me"); }}>Click me</Button>
```
