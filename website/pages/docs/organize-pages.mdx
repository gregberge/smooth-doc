## Type of pages

Smooth DOC has two types of pages: `doc` and `page`.

- The `doc` page have a specific layout with a side navigation.
- The `page` is a simple page with basic layout (header).

All pages written in `pages` directory are of type `page`, except pages present in `pages/docs` directory that have a type `doc`.

An example of pages structure:

```
pages/
├── index.mdx
├── docs/
│   └── index.mdx
├── getting-started.mdx
└── reference.mdx
```
