- A license that gives you right to use it in your projects
- A personal license key and instructions to unlock the full version of Smooth DOC

## What about version compatibility

Smooth DOC is compatible with Gatsby v2 and React v16.3+.

## What browsers does Smooth DOC support?

Smooth DOC is designed to work in the latest, stable releases of all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Internet Explorer is not supported.

## What does "free updates" includes?

Smooth DOC is not frozen in time, I update it regularly to be compatible with the latest versions of Gatsby and React. There may also be new features emerging!

Also, Smooth DOC is distributed throught [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), you will be able to update it like any other package!

## Can I use Smooth DOC for client projects?

## Can I use Smooth DOC for my own commercial projects?

Absolutely! Your license gives you permission to build as many of your own projects as you like, whether they are simple public websites or SaaS applications that end users need to pay to access.

For more information and examples, [read through our license](/docs/license/).

## Can I use Smooth DOC in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's totally okay for that project to be open source.
