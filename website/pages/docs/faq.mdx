## What does "free updates" includes?

Smooth DOC is not frozen in time, I update it regularly to be compatible with the latest versions of Gatsby and React. There may also be new features emerging!

## Can I use Smooth DOC for my own commercial projects?

## Can I use Smooth DOC in open source projects?

Yep! As long as what you're building is some sort of actual website and not a derivative component library, theme builder, or other product where the primary purpose is clearly to repackage and redistribute our components, it's totally okay for that project to be open source.
