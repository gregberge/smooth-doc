# x.\*

A primitive to write CSS using props.

<carbon-ad />

## Usage

Smooth DOC uses [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/) under the hood. It gives you access to the `x` component as a primitive to style everything without writing any line of CSS.

```js live noInline
import { x } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

render(<x.div w={200} h={50} bg="primary" />)
```

> Read [xstyled documentation](https://xstyled.dev/docs/) to know more about it.
