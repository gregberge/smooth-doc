## Use your own 404 page

By default Smooth DOC provides a [404 webpage](/404/). You can customize it by creating a `pages/404.mdx`.

The page will be served when a page is not found.

## Default 404 page

```js
---
# 404.mdx
title: Page not found
---

import { Box } from '@xstyled/styled-components'
import { Article, ScreenContainer } from 'smooth-doc/components'

<Article style={{ textAlign: 'center', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <ScreenContainer>
    <h1>Page not found</h1>
    <Box forwardedAs="p" my={3} mx="auto">
      We couldn't find what you were looking for.
    </Box>
  </ScreenContainer>
