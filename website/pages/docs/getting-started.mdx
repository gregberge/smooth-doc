# Overview

Getting started with Smooth DOC.

<carbon-ad />

## What is exactly Smooth DOC?

Smooth DOC is a [Gatsby theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/). [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) is a static website generator, a Gatsby theme is pre-configured Gatsby configuration that includes logic, components, styles, JavaScript, everything to run your website.

After buying Smooth DOC, you are ready to start, everything is set up for you! Basically, it is a time saver. Building a Gatsby website like Smooth DOC from scratch takes weeks.

## Why I created it?

As the maintainer of large libraries such as [SVGR](https://react-svgr.com/), [Loadable Components](https://loadable-components.com/) or [xstyled](https://xstyled.dev/) I had to create and I have to maintain many sites.

I quickly created a system to be able to generate these many sites. At this time, Gatsby was still in boxes and other tools were not flexible enough for me.

Initially Smooth DOC was just a utility library to share common React components. Over the years, I added more and more features: Carbon Ads, React Live Editor, Dark Mode, SEO...

Converting it into a Gatsby theme made it very portable and reusable. After a big work of refactoring, Smooth DOC was born!

## What are the differences with other documentation generators?

Smooth DOC is opinionated, it generates a pro-quality documentation website with a minimal configuration.

It includes several features:

- MDX Support
- React Live Editor
- Full theme customization
- Dark mode support
- GitHub Links
- Social Image Sharing
- Carbon Ads support
- Netlify deployment
- Table of contents
- Built-in components
- ..and many other features!

All of these features make Smooth DOC the most advanced documentation system.

## Personalize options

Like all Gatsby themes, Smooth DOC accepts some options. To make it yours, change the name and the description in your `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: 'smooth-doc',
      options: {
        // Name of your website
        name: 'Smooth DOC',
        // Description of your website
        description: 'Ready to use documentation theme for Gatsby.',
        // Production URL of your website
        siteURL: 'https://smooth-doc.com',
      },
    },
  ],
}
```
