# Deploy

Make your website available for everyone.

## Create production build

Smooth DOC is just a Gatsby theme, to create an optimized production build, run:

```js
gatsby build
```

> Read more about directly in [Gatsby documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/#create-a-production-build)

## Deploy on Netlify

Smooth DOC is already optimized for [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). It does several things for you:

- `siteURL` is automatically filled for you (in production and deploy preview)
- `robots.txt` will disallow indexing for deploy preview

To deploy on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/), follow [Gatsby guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/deploying-to-netlify/).

## Deploy on other providers

Since Smooth DOC is based on Gatsby and generates a static website, it can be deployed anywhere. Gatsby has a great [documentation about deploying a project](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/deploying-and-hosting/).

> Be careful of having `NODE_ENV=production` when you deploy, else the `robots.txt` will disallow indexing.
