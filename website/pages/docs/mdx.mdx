```

## Metadata

```md
---
title: Write MDX # Title of your page
slug: /docs/write-mdx/ # Slug of your page (uses file name as default)
section: Usage # Sidebar navigation group title
order: 2 # Order in the sidebar navigation group
---

Your page content...
```

## Code

````md
An example of code block:

```js
const foo = 'bar'
```

Hello, I'm still a mdx file, but now I have a button component !

<Button onClick={() => { alert("You clicked me"); }}>Click me</Button>
```
