## Getting Started

The easiest way to start a new project is to use the Gatsby starter. It generates a ready-to-use project with all needed dependencies.

### Create your website:

```bash
npx gatsby-cli new doc-website https://github.com/gregberge/gatsby-starter-smooth-doc
```

### Change directories into site folder

```bash
cd doc-website
```

### Start development server

```bash
npm run develop
```

Gatsby will start a hot-reloading development environment accessible by default at http://localhost:8000.

Try editing the home page in `pages/index.mdx`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

> The previous commands will install preview of Smooth DOC. You have to <a href="https://gum.co/smooth-doc" data-gumroad-single-product="true">buy Smooth DOC</a> to get full version of the product.
